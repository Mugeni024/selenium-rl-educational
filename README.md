## üéÆ How It Works

### 1. Environment Setup
The AI interacts with web pages through Selenium WebDriver:
```python
# Web environment manages browser interactions
environment = WebEnvironment(target_url="file://demo/test_form.html")
```

### 2. Q-Learning Agent
The AI uses Q-Learning to learn optimal actions:
```python
# Agent learns through trial and error
agent = QLearningAgent(learning_rate=0.1, epsilon=0.1, discount=0.9)
```

### 3. Training Loop
Episodes run until the AI learns to complete the task:
```python
for episode in range(max_episodes):
    state = environment.reset()
    while not done:
        action = agent.choose_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done = environment.step(action)
        agent.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
```
