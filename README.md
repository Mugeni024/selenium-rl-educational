## Introduction

Reinforcement learning is a fascinating area of artificial intelligence. This project focuses on using Q-Learning to train agents to perform tasks on websites. The goal is to provide an educational platform where you can learn the fundamentals of RL while applying them in a practical setting.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a basic understanding of Python and some familiarity with web automation. This repository is beginner-friendly and provides a structured approach to learning.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with web automation concepts

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
selenium-rl-educational/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py          # Q-Learning agent implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ environment.py    # Web environment setup
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py           # Main execution file
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Required Python packages
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation
```

- **agent.py**: Contains the Q-Learning agent logic.
- **environment.py**: Sets up the web environment for the agent to interact with.
- **main.py**: The entry point for running the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the necessary packages for the project.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mugeni024/selenium-rl-educational.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd selenium-rl-educational
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The agent will start navigating the specified website using Q-Learning. Monitor the console for updates on the agent's progress and rewards.

## Q-Learning Explained

Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. It helps an agent learn the value of actions taken in a given state. The agent receives rewards based on its actions, allowing it to learn the best strategy over time.

### Key Concepts

- **State**: A representation of the environment at a specific time.
- **Action**: A decision made by the agent that affects the state.
- **Reward**: Feedback received from the environment based on the action taken.
- **Q-Value**: A value representing the quality of a particular action in a given state.

### The Q-Learning Formula

The Q-Learning update rule is as follows:

```
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + Î± * (r + Î³ * max(Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a))
```

Where:
- \( s \) is the current state
- \( a \) is the action taken
- \( r \) is the reward received
- \( s' \) is the new state after taking action \( a \)
- \( Î± \) is the learning rate
- \( Î³ \) is the discount factor

This formula allows the agent to update its knowledge and improve its performance over time.

## Selenium WebDriver

Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web applications. It allows you to programmatically control a web browser, making it ideal for testing and web scraping. In this project, Selenium WebDriver is used to interact with web pages, enabling the agent to perform actions like clicking buttons and filling out forms.

### Key Features of Selenium

- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works with multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Supports various languages like Python, Java, and C#.
- **Rich API**: Provides a wide range of functions for web automation.
